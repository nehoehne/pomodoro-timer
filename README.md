# pomodoro-timer
A simple app for timing Pomodoro sessions: a productivity method where you work for 25 minutes then take a 5-minute break then repeat. 

## Usage 
Ensure you have nodejs downloaded then run the following from the rout directory: 
```
npm install 
node index [# of sessions]
```
Or use one of the batch files (e.g. run5.bat starts a session 5 rounds or 2.5 hours long).
